// Here at Conformity Inc. we only like even things. We need you to put a stop to anything that does not conform to our strict even only policy.

// Write a function that will convert any number to its nearest even number. When the number is halfway between two even numbers it should round away from zero.

// Examples

// 1 => 2

// 0.5 => 0

// -1 => -2

// -0.5 => 0



function ensureEven(n) {
  // Code on squire...
  
}

console.log(ensureEven(1)) // 2
console.log(ensureEven(0.5)) // 0
console.log(ensureEven(-1)) // -2
console.log(ensureEven(-0.5)) // 0
